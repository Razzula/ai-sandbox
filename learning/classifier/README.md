# bi-classifier

A simple binary classifier that uses a dataset to train a model and then uses the model to predict the class of new data.

Implemented using a bag of words model and the Naive Bayes classifier.

The included `spam.csv` dataset, as an example, has around 5.5k examples of messages, both spam and 'ham' (not spam).
